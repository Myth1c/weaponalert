# weaponalert

Weapon alert is a system designed to display icons above a player's head for various weapon types.

Currently, it is not designed to be used on any servers except the one it is developed for. 

# What it does so far: 

- Displays 4 different icons above a players head. One for weapons, one for handcuffs, one for stunsticks, and one for misc criminal weapons such as lockpicks.

# Plans for the future:

- Allow for user customization on how it appears on their end
- Allow for server customization of what weapons to check for
- Allow for server customization of what icons to display for new groups
